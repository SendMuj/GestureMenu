This is just a small project I decided to work on, encorporating a few different ideas I'd either had or seen somewhere else. FIgured it would be
good practice.

A basic interactive menu navigated by simple gesture controls, raisning fingers/moving your hand etc;

There is certainly more functionality that could be added: opening/closing menu, a method to change what apps can be opened with the Apps options, display for audio levels, etc;

A better UI could also be made, or even more complex gesture control could be used, though that would be a much larger change to the project.

I'll be calling this project done here though, since I want to move to other projects that are closer in subject to what I want to be doing for a career, and since I also accomplished what I wanted with this project, mostly getting some light experience with cv2 and cvzone.
